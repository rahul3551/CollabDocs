# Pending Tasks

See [PROGRESS_TRACKER.md](./PROGRESS_TRACKER.md) for full details and owners.

- [ ] Request-logging middleware (not implemented — not in `MIDDLEWARE`, no middleware file)
- [ ] AuditLog read API (`GET /api/audit-logs/`) — serializer, view, and URL are all missing/broken
- [ ] Workspace Summary endpoint (listed above under API Modules, not actually built)
- [ ] Demo video (Loom/Drive link)
- [ ] Fill in the Module Ownership table and Contributors list in this README
